# stop spamming

See [this HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32242374)

Hey folks, I also just got a lovely email from you. Since you delete every
single issue I thought i'd try it with a PR. I think PRs can't be deleted, but
I guess we'll find out.

[Here](mail.txt) is the spam message I received. You are scraping commit logs
for this. How do I know that? Because the email that this was sent to, I only
use for commit logs.

Anyway, I don't think I have to tell you why the thing you're doing is wrong.
Numerous people already have reported you to GitHub and they're not going to do
anything.
